# PoeTradeProject
A simple "Path of Exile" trade helper/sniper program. 

Require: Windows 10. Can probably work on windows 7 (not tested) with .net framework 4.52 or above. 
This program is a simple wrapper around chrome browser and let you do 2 main things.
1. Manage live search on the official PoE trade site and whenever new item comes up, add the item to a queue. You can than press 
a hot key to send a trade message to the active window (this should be the PoE client). This way, you can have this program run in
the background while playing the game and than send the trade message when new items come up without alt tabing/moving out of the 
game client. 

2. Create items list from bulk item exchange search. Once the list is made, you can stay in the PoE client and 'pop' trade messages
from the list by pressing a single hot key. 

Installing: 
Go to the 'Setup Files' folder :  https://github.com/p0miki/PoeTradeProject/blob/master/Setup%20Files/PoETradeHelper.zip
download the setup.zip, unzip and run the setup.exe file. 
Setup DOESN'T create any shortcut, so NOTICE where you install the file. 
Once setup is done, naviage to the install folder and run 'PoETradeHelper.exe'
